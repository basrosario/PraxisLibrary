                            <li><strong>Keep your voice.</strong> AI should sound like you, not like a robot. Edit ruthlessly to maintain authenticity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Templates are gold.</strong> Create once, customize always. AI helps you build the template, you make it personal each time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Don't over-automate relationships.</strong> AI for efficiency, humans for connection. Know the difference.</li>
                            <li><strong>Verify important outputs.</strong> AI makes mistakes. Double-check anything customer-facing or high-stakes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Your expertise matters.</strong> AI is fast but you know your customers, market, and business. Stay in the driver's seat.</li>
