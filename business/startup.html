[My Research Context]
Product idea: [What I'm exploring]
Target customer: [Who I want to interview]
Core hypothesis: [What I'm trying to learn]
What I'm afraid to hear: [What would disprove my idea]

[Constraints]
- Questions should uncover truth, not validation
- Focus on past behavior, not future intentions
- Ask about their life, not my solution
- Make it conversational, not an interrogation</div>

                            <li><strong>Don't outsource thinking.</strong> Use AI to explore ideas and challenge assumptions, but the decisions are yours.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ship imperfect things.</strong> AI can help you iterate faster, but don't let it become perfectionism in disguise.</li>
