                            <li><strong>Keep your voice.</strong> AI writes the draft, you add the personality. Your clients know your vibe—keep it consistent.</li>
                            <li><strong>Showcase real work.</strong> Your photos are your portfolio. AI captions make them shine, but the work speaks loudest.</li>
                            <li><strong>Protect client privacy.</strong> Never share identifying details without permission, even with AI.</li>
                            <li><strong>Save the templates.</strong> Once you create good messages, save them. Don't reinvent every time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stay human.</strong> Personal texts and genuine compliments still matter. AI handles the routine; you handle the special.</li>
