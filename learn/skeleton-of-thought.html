                        <span class="highlight-box__title">Framework Context: 2023</span>
                        <p><strong>Introduced:</strong> Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT) was introduced in 2023 by Ning et al. in &ldquo;Skeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding.&rdquo; The research demonstrated that LLM response latency could be reduced by up to 2x by splitting generation into two phases: first producing a skeleton (outline of key points), then expanding each skeleton point independently. Because the expansion of each point does not depend on the others, these expansions can run in parallel across multiple API calls or batched requests. The technique was tested on GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA models across diverse question types.</p>
                        <p><strong>Modern LLM Status:</strong> Skeleton-of-Thought has become <strong>an important latency optimization technique for production AI systems</strong>. The core insight &mdash; that many responses can be decomposed into independently expandable sections &mdash; influences modern streaming architectures and parallel generation strategies. While native LLM inference is still autoregressive (sequential token generation), SoT&rsquo;s principle has been adopted in practice through parallel API calls, speculative decoding research, and structured output generation. The technique is particularly valuable for long-form content generation, multi-part answers, and any application where response latency affects user experience.</p>

                        <h2 class="split-section__title">Outline First, Expand in Parallel</h2>
                        <p class="split-section__text">Traditional LLM generation is brutally sequential: every token depends on every previous token. A 2,000-word response requires the model to generate each word one after another, with no opportunity for parallelism. The first sentence must be complete before the second begins, the first paragraph before the second. For complex, multi-part responses, this sequential bottleneck means users wait while the model slowly writes from beginning to end.</p>
                        <p class="split-section__text"><strong>Skeleton-of-Thought exploits a key observation: many responses have independently expandable sections.</strong> When asked to explain a concept, the model might produce five key points. Each point can be elaborated without knowing the details of the others &mdash; only the skeleton (the outline of points) needs to be generated sequentially. Once the skeleton exists, all expansions can happen simultaneously, collapsing a serial process into a parallel one.</p>
                        <p class="split-section__text">Think of it like building a house. The framing (skeleton) must go up first &mdash; you need to know where the rooms are. But once the frame is in place, you can wire the electrical, plumb the pipes, and install the drywall all at the same time. You don&rsquo;t need to finish the kitchen before starting the bathroom. Skeleton-of-Thought applies this same parallel-after-planning principle to text generation.</p>

                                <span class="highlight-box__title">Speed Without Sacrificing Structure</span>
                                <p>The beauty of Skeleton-of-Thought is that the speed improvement comes from better organization, not from cutting corners. The skeleton phase forces the model to plan its response structure before writing, which often produces more coherent and well-organized output than standard sequential generation. You get faster responses AND better structure &mdash; the outline-first approach is a rare case where the optimization also improves quality.</p>

                    <p>Skeleton-of-Thought embodies a fundamental computer science principle: identify the serial dependencies in a process, minimize them, and parallelize everything else. In traditional generation, the serial dependency spans the entire response &mdash; every token depends on all previous tokens. SoT reduces the serial dependency to just the skeleton, making the bulk of the generation (the expansions) embarrassingly parallel. This same principle drives performance optimization across all of computing, from CPU pipelines to distributed systems.</p>
