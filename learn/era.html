            <div class="container">
                <div class="highlight-box highlight-box--warning fade-in-up">

                        <p><strong>Introduced:</strong> The ERA Framework (Expectation, Role, Action) emerged from the prompt engineering community in 2024 as a deliberate inversion of the role-first approach used by most structured frameworks. While frameworks like CRISP and CO-STAR typically begin by assigning the AI a persona, ERA argues that defining the expected outcome first produces more goal-aligned responses. The reasoning: when you tell an AI what success looks like before telling it who to be, every subsequent decision &mdash; including how to inhabit the role &mdash; is anchored to the end goal.</p>
                        <p><strong>Modern LLM Status:</strong> ERA remains a <strong>practical and effective framework</strong> for goal-oriented prompting. Its expectation-first ordering aligns with how modern LLMs process context: early tokens in a prompt have disproportionate influence on output direction. By placing the desired outcome at the beginning, ERA leverages this primacy effect to steer the AI before role or task instructions add complexity. Whether you use Claude, GPT-4, or Gemini, leading with a clear expectation consistently produces outputs that are more tightly aligned with your actual goals.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <div class="split-section split-section--align-start fade-in-up">

                        <h2 class="split-section__title">Define the Destination Before the Journey</h2>
                        <p class="split-section__text">Most prompts follow a natural but suboptimal order: &ldquo;Be a [role] and do [action].&rdquo; The problem is that without knowing the desired outcome, the AI interprets the role broadly and the action generically. A &ldquo;marketing expert&rdquo; could write anything from a billboard tagline to a 50-page strategy document &mdash; the role alone does not constrain the output enough.</p>
                        <p class="split-section__text"><strong>ERA reverses the sequence.</strong> By stating the Expectation first &mdash; what the final output should look like, who it serves, and how success is measured &mdash; you give the AI a target to aim at before it even knows what role to adopt. The Role then becomes purpose-built for that specific outcome, and the Action becomes the precise steps needed to deliver it. Every component serves the goal.</p>
                        <p class="split-section__text">Think of it like briefing a consultant. You would not start by saying &ldquo;Be an analyst&rdquo; &mdash; you would say &ldquo;I need a board-ready slide deck showing our market position by Friday&rdquo; (expectation), then specify &ldquo;approach this as a competitive intelligence analyst&rdquo; (role), then detail the specific research tasks (action). The expectation shapes everything that follows.</p>

                                <span class="highlight-box__title">The Primacy Advantage</span>
                                <p>In natural language processing, earlier tokens in a prompt carry more weight in shaping the model&rsquo;s response trajectory. This is known as the primacy effect. By placing your expected outcome at the very beginning of the prompt, ERA takes advantage of this phenomenon &mdash; the AI&rsquo;s entire processing of the subsequent role and action is already conditioned by the goal you stated first. This is not just a theoretical benefit: prompts that lead with outcomes consistently produce more focused, goal-aligned results than those that lead with roles or tasks.</p>

Consider factors like inflation, healthcare costs, and lifestyle goals. Start by maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers matching.

                    <p>ERA&rsquo;s key insight is that the sequence of information in a prompt is not arbitrary. Placing expectations first primes the AI&rsquo;s entire response generation toward that goal. This is analogous to writing a thesis statement before the body of an essay &mdash; everything that follows is automatically organized around the central claim. If you find that role-first frameworks produce outputs that are well-written but miss your actual goal, try leading with your expectation instead. The role and action will naturally sharpen to serve that outcome. And as always, verify the final output before relying on it.</p>
