                        <span class="highlight-box__title">Framework Context: 2024</span>
                        <p><strong>Introduced:</strong> BORE gained traction in 2024 within professional and business AI communities as a concise framework optimized for workplace communication. The acronym stands for Background, Objective, Role, and Expectation &mdash; four components that mirror how effective business briefs are structured. BORE&rsquo;s distinguishing feature is its emphasis on Background over generic &ldquo;context&rdquo; &mdash; encouraging users to provide the history, situation, and circumstances that shaped the current need, rather than just a surface-level description of what is happening now. This deeper contextual grounding helps the AI produce responses that account for organizational history and strategic nuance.</p>
                        <p><strong>Modern LLM Status:</strong> BORE remains <strong>practical and well-suited for professional environments</strong> where prompts need to be efficient but thorough. Its four-component structure is lean enough for daily use while covering the dimensions that matter most in business communication. Whether you use Claude, GPT-4, or Gemini, providing historical background, a clear objective, an appropriate role, and measurable expectations consistently produces output that is more aligned with real-world professional needs than unstructured requests. BORE is especially effective in enterprise contexts where the AI needs to understand not just what you want, but why you want it and how you will measure its value.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <div class="split-section split-section--align-start fade-in-up">

                        <h2 class="split-section__title">Background Is Not Context &mdash; It Is Deeper</h2>
                        <p class="split-section__text">Many frameworks ask for &ldquo;context,&rdquo; which users typically interpret as a brief description of the current situation. But the most effective prompts go further &mdash; they provide the history, the decisions that led to this moment, the constraints inherited from past choices, and the organizational dynamics that shape what is possible. BORE&rsquo;s Background component explicitly asks for this deeper layer.</p>
                        <p class="split-section__text"><strong>BORE treats every prompt as a mini business case.</strong> Background provides the narrative: what happened before, what constraints exist, and why this task matters now. Objective defines the specific deliverable. Role assigns the expertise and perspective the AI should bring. Expectation sets the measurable bar &mdash; how the output will be evaluated, what format it needs, and what success looks like in concrete terms.</p>
                        <p class="split-section__text">Think of it like the difference between telling a consultant &ldquo;we need a marketing plan&rdquo; versus &ldquo;we tried content marketing for two years with declining engagement, pivoted to events last quarter with 40% better lead quality, and now need a plan that builds on the events momentum while reactivating our content pipeline.&rdquo; The second version &mdash; with real background &mdash; produces dramatically better recommendations.</p>

                                <span class="highlight-box__title">Why Background Changes the Output</span>
                                <p>Without background, an AI generates advice for a generic version of your situation. With background, it generates advice for your specific situation. A marketing plan for a company that just pivoted from content to events looks completely different from one for a startup with no marketing history. The Background component forces you to provide the narrative that separates your request from every similar request the AI has ever seen &mdash; and that specificity is what produces genuinely useful output.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Background:</strong> Our 300-person company currently uses Salesforce for CRM but our contract expires in 90 days. Sales team adoption is at 45% (down from 70% two years ago). The main complaints are complexity and slow performance. We evaluated HubSpot last year but rejected it due to limited custom reporting.

                                    <strong>Role:</strong> You are a CTO who has overseen three CRM migrations at mid-size companies. You evaluate tools based on total cost of ownership, adoption risk, and integration complexity rather than feature checklists.<br><br>

                                    The reporting objection that killed HubSpot last year is no longer valid &mdash; your standalone analytics layer handles the custom reporting that HubSpot lacks natively.

                                    <p><strong>Background:</strong> We launched our mobile app 6 weeks ago after 8 months of development. Pre-launch waitlist had 12,000 sign-ups. First-week downloads: 8,200. Current DAU: 1,100 (down from 3,400 in week 1). App store rating: 3.2 stars (target was 4.0+). Top complaint in reviews: &ldquo;onboarding is confusing&rdquo; (mentioned in 40% of 1&ndash;2 star reviews). We spent $45K on launch marketing. Our competitors&rsquo; apps average 4.3 stars.<br><br>
                                    <strong>Objective:</strong> Write a candid post-launch analysis that identifies what went wrong, what went right, and recommends next steps for the next 30 days.<br><br>
                                    <strong>Role:</strong> You are a VP of Product at a consumer tech company who has launched and iterated on 5 mobile apps. You believe in data-driven post-mortems and are known for honest assessments that teams trust.<br><br>
                                    <strong>Expectation:</strong> Structure as: What Worked, What Did Not, Root Cause Analysis, 30-Day Action Plan with priorities. Include specific metrics targets for the next 30 days. Under 700 words. Audience is the executive team. All metrics cited should be verified against actual analytics dashboards before circulating the report.</p>

                                    &bull; Pre-launch waitlist conversion: 68% of waitlist (8,200/12,000) downloaded in week 1 &mdash; strong demand signal<br>
                                    &bull; Core functionality performs well: Users who complete onboarding show 4.1-star satisfaction in in-app surveys...<br><br>
                                    <strong>Root Cause</strong><br>
                                    The 67% DAU decline (3,400 to 1,100) is primarily an onboarding problem, not a product problem. Users who get through onboarding retain well. The funnel data tells the story: 8,200 downloads &rarr; 5,100 completed registration &rarr; 2,800 started onboarding &rarr; 1,600 completed it. We are losing 69% of users before they experience the core product...<br><br>

                    <p>BORE and CO-STAR occupy different niches despite similar complexity. BORE excels when the task is analytical or strategic &mdash; business decisions, post-mortems, vendor evaluations &mdash; where historical context drives the quality of recommendations. CO-STAR excels when the task is communicative &mdash; marketing copy, stakeholder emails, presentations &mdash; where audience, tone, and style precision matter most. Choose based on whether your output needs to be strategically grounded or communicatively precise. And always verify the AI&rsquo;s output against actual data before using it in decisions.</p>
