                        <p><strong>Introduced:</strong> Tree of Thought (ToT) was published in 2023 by Yao et al. The technique generalizes Chain-of-Thought prompting by structuring reasoning as a tree rather than a single chain. At each step, the model generates multiple candidate &ldquo;thoughts&rdquo; (partial solutions), evaluates how promising each branch is, and uses search algorithms &mdash; breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) &mdash; to navigate the tree. Crucially, ToT can backtrack from unpromising paths, something linear prompting cannot do. The original paper demonstrated dramatic improvements on tasks like the Game of 24, creative writing, and crossword puzzles.</p>
                        <p><strong>Modern LLM Status:</strong> The core insight of ToT &mdash; exploring and evaluating multiple reasoning paths before committing &mdash; has influenced how modern LLMs approach complex tasks internally. Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini show improved deliberative reasoning compared to earlier models. However, <strong>explicit ToT prompting remains highly valuable</strong> for tasks that genuinely require search and exploration: mathematical puzzles, strategic planning, constraint satisfaction, and creative ideation where the first path is rarely the best path. The technique is especially powerful when paired with structured evaluation criteria that let the model systematically assess each branch&rsquo;s viability.</p>

                        <h2 class="split-section__title">Reasoning as Search, Not Narration</h2>
                        <p class="split-section__text">Standard prompting treats reasoning like writing a paragraph &mdash; one sentence follows the next in a single forward direction. If the model takes a wrong turn at step two, everything that follows inherits that error. There is no mechanism to reconsider, compare alternatives, or recover from mistakes. Chain-of-Thought improved things by making the reasoning explicit, but it is still a single chain with no branches.</p>
                        <p class="split-section__text"><strong>Tree of Thought reframes reasoning as a search problem.</strong> Instead of generating one linear sequence, the model builds a tree where each node is a partial solution and each edge represents a reasoning step. At every node, the model generates multiple candidate next-steps, evaluates which branches look most promising, and decides where to explore next. When a branch leads nowhere, the model backtracks to a previous node and tries a different direction.</p>
                        <p class="split-section__text">Think of it like a chess player who considers several possible moves, mentally plays out each one a few turns ahead, discards the ones that lead to bad positions, and then commits to the most promising line of play.</p>

                                <p>Many real-world problems have a branching solution space &mdash; multiple valid approaches, dead ends that look promising at first, and solutions that only emerge after trying and discarding alternatives. A single chain commits to one path and hopes it works. A tree explores the landscape systematically, concentrating effort on the most promising regions and abandoning paths that evaluation reveals as unlikely to succeed. This is the same principle behind how search algorithms, game-playing AI, and human experts solve difficult problems.</p>

                            <p class="element-timeline__text">Use a search algorithm to navigate the tree. Breadth-first search (BFS) explores all branches at one depth before going deeper &mdash; good when evaluation is reliable. Depth-first search (DFS) follows one promising path deep, then backtracks if it fails &mdash; good when solutions are deep in the tree. The ability to backtrack and try alternative branches is the key advantage over linear reasoning.</p>

                    <p>Tree of Thought and Self-Consistency are complementary multi-path techniques. Self-Consistency generates multiple complete solutions and votes on the best answer. ToT generates multiple partial solutions at each step and evaluates them incrementally. For maximum reliability on critical problems, you can use ToT to find solution candidates and then apply Self-Consistency voting across the final answers from different branches.</p>
