                        <span class="highlight-box__title">Technique Context: 2022&ndash;2024</span>
                        <p><strong>Introduced:</strong> AI-assisted code review evolved rapidly between 2022 and 2024, building on decades of automated static analysis tools like ESLint, SonarQube, and Pylint that could catch syntactic errors and style violations but lacked semantic understanding. The arrival of large language models capable of reasoning about code &mdash; starting with Codex and accelerating through GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini &mdash; transformed code review from pattern-matching into contextual analysis. GitHub Copilot introduced code review features that could evaluate pull requests against project conventions, while dedicated tools emerged for security scanning, performance profiling, and architectural assessment. By 2024, AI code review had moved beyond simple linting to encompass multi-dimensional analysis: understanding business logic intent, evaluating algorithmic complexity, identifying security vulnerabilities in context, and assessing how changes interact with the broader codebase.</p>
                        <p><strong>Modern LLM Status:</strong> AI-assisted code review is <strong>widely adopted in professional development workflows</strong> and continues to improve as models gain deeper understanding of codebases, frameworks, and security patterns. Frontier models can analyze code across multiple dimensions simultaneously &mdash; security, performance, correctness, maintainability, and style &mdash; when given properly structured prompts. The core techniques covered here &mdash; specifying review dimensions, defining standards to apply, establishing severity levels, and providing codebase context &mdash; are essential because models without explicit review guidance tend to produce shallow, generic feedback that misses the issues developers actually care about. Code review prompting forms a critical complement to code explanation and self-debugging techniques, enabling comprehensive quality assurance workflows.</p>

                        <h2 class="split-section__title">Tell the Reviewer What to Look For</h2>
                        <p class="split-section__text">Code review prompting is the practice of structuring AI prompts to perform systematic, multi-dimensional analysis of source code. Rather than simply asking a model to &ldquo;review this code,&rdquo; effective code review prompting specifies <strong>what dimensions to review</strong> (security, performance, correctness, maintainability, style), <strong>what standards to apply</strong> (project conventions, language best practices, framework idioms), and <strong>what severity levels to flag</strong> (critical bugs, warnings, suggestions, nitpicks).</p>
                        <p class="split-section__text"><strong>The core insight is that AI code review requires specifying WHAT dimensions to review, what STANDARDS to apply, and what SEVERITY levels to flag.</strong> Without this structure, models default to surface-level observations &mdash; noting variable naming inconsistencies or missing comments while overlooking SQL injection vulnerabilities, race conditions, or O(n&sup2;) algorithms hidden inside loops. A structured review prompt transforms the model from a passive reader into an active auditor with a defined checklist and clear reporting criteria.</p>
                        <p class="split-section__text">Think of it like the difference between asking a building inspector to &ldquo;look around&rdquo; versus handing them an inspection checklist covering structural integrity, electrical safety, plumbing codes, fire exits, and accessibility compliance. The same inspector with the same expertise produces dramatically different reports depending on the structure of the review protocol. Code review prompting is that protocol for AI models.</p>

                                <span class="highlight-box__title">Why Dimension Specificity Transforms Code Review</span>
                                <p>When a model receives code without structured review criteria, it defaults to the most obvious observations &mdash; naming conventions, missing documentation, and simple style issues that any linter could catch. Structured review prompts redirect this behavior by defining the <strong>analytical dimensions</strong> the model should apply: what security patterns to check for, what performance thresholds matter, which correctness edge cases to consider, what maintainability standards the team follows, and how to prioritize findings by business impact rather than cosmetic importance. The difference between a generic &ldquo;looks fine, maybe add some comments&rdquo; and a structured report identifying an unvalidated user input path, a missing database index on a frequently queried column, and a potential null reference in an error handler comes down entirely to the specificity of the review prompt.</p>

                            <p class="element-timeline__text">Provide the code you want reviewed, along with relevant context about the project, language, and framework. Include the specific files or diff under review, and where possible, describe the purpose of the change &mdash; whether it is a new feature, a bug fix, a refactor, or a performance optimization. Context about what the code is supposed to do is just as important as the code itself, because many code review findings depend on understanding intent: a function that appears correct in isolation may be completely wrong given the business requirements it was written to fulfill.</p>

                            <p class="element-timeline__text">Specify which aspects of the code the model should evaluate. Common review dimensions include security (injection, authentication, authorization, data exposure), performance (algorithmic complexity, memory usage, database queries, caching), correctness (edge cases, error handling, type safety, boundary conditions), maintainability (readability, modularity, naming, documentation), and standards compliance (language idioms, framework patterns, project conventions). Selecting dimensions focuses the review on what matters most for the specific change being evaluated.</p>

                                <span class="element-timeline__example-label">Example</span>
                                <p>&ldquo;Review this code across four dimensions: (1) Security &mdash; check for injection vulnerabilities, improper token handling, and missing input validation; (2) Performance &mdash; evaluate database query efficiency and identify any N+1 query patterns; (3) Error handling &mdash; verify all failure paths return appropriate HTTP status codes and log sufficient context; (4) Standards &mdash; check adherence to our REST API naming conventions and response format.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p class="element-timeline__text">Provide the standards, conventions, and project-specific context the model should apply during the review. This includes language-specific best practices, framework documentation patterns, team coding conventions, security policies, and any architectural constraints. Without explicit standards, the model applies generic best practices that may conflict with your project&rsquo;s established patterns. Including examples of approved code patterns and known anti-patterns in your codebase dramatically improves the relevance of findings.</p>

The per-component organization with an overall maintainability score provides both detailed actionable feedback and a high-level assessment that helps teams prioritize refactoring efforts across a large codebase.</p>

                    <p>AI-assisted code review works best as a complement to human reviewers, not a replacement. Use structured code review prompts to handle the systematic, checklist-driven analysis that humans find tedious and error-prone &mdash; scanning every line for injection vulnerabilities, verifying consistent error handling, checking for N+1 queries, and enforcing naming conventions. This frees human reviewers to focus on what they do best: evaluating architectural decisions, assessing whether the approach solves the right problem, judging code readability from a team context perspective, and considering edge cases that require domain knowledge the model may lack. The strongest code review workflows run AI review first, then present findings alongside the diff for human reviewers to triage, accept, or override.</p>
