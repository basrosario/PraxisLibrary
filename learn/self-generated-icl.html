                        <p><strong>Introduced:</strong> Self-Generated ICL was proposed in 2022 by Kim et al. as a method to overcome one of the most persistent bottlenecks in few-shot prompting: the need for high-quality, manually curated demonstration examples. The key observation was that large language models already possess sufficient knowledge to generate their own task demonstrations &mdash; and that these self-created examples can serve as effective in-context learning signals when prepended to the actual query.</p>
                        <p><strong>Modern LLM Status:</strong> Self-Generated ICL is an <strong>active and practical technique</strong>. The approach has the model generate its own few-shot examples before tackling the actual task, eliminating the need for manually curated demonstrations. With modern LLMs being strong generators, self-generated examples are often surprisingly high quality and well-suited to the task at hand. The technique is particularly valuable when labeled data is scarce or unavailable, when working in specialized domains where example creation requires expertise, or when you want the model to calibrate its own understanding of the task before answering. Recent work has shown that self-generated examples can match or exceed the performance of human-written examples for many NLP tasks.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <div class="split-section split-section--center fade-in-up">

                        <h2 class="split-section__title">Let the Model Teach Itself by Example</h2>
                        <p class="split-section__text">Few-shot prompting works remarkably well &mdash; but it has an uncomfortable dependency: someone has to write the examples. Crafting high-quality demonstrations takes time, domain expertise, and careful formatting. For specialized tasks like medical coding, legal extraction, or niche classification, creating even three good examples can require a subject-matter expert and hours of iteration.</p>
                        <p class="split-section__text"><strong>Self-Generated ICL removes that bottleneck entirely.</strong> Instead of asking a human to write demonstrations, you ask the model itself: &ldquo;Generate three examples of this task being performed correctly.&rdquo; The model draws on its training data to produce plausible input-output pairs, and those self-created examples then serve as the few-shot context for the real query. The model becomes both the teacher and the student.</p>
                        <p class="split-section__text">Think of it like a musician warming up before a performance. Rather than jumping straight into the concert piece, the musician plays scales and short passages in the same key and tempo &mdash; calibrating their hands, ears, and focus. Self-Generated ICL gives the model the same warm-up: it rehearses the task pattern before the real performance begins.</p>

                                <p>Large language models have internalized millions of task patterns from their training data. When you ask a model to generate examples of a task, it draws on that vast implicit knowledge to produce demonstrations that are naturally well-formatted, contextually appropriate, and stylistically consistent. These self-generated examples often capture subtle task requirements &mdash; like output length, tone, and structure &mdash; that are difficult to specify in instructions alone. The model essentially <strong>externalizes its own understanding</strong> of the task, then uses that externalized knowledge as a reference point.</p>

                    <p>Self-generated examples are not guaranteed to be perfect. For higher-stakes applications, consider filtering strategies: generate more examples than you need and select the best subset, use the model to self-evaluate its own examples for correctness, or combine self-generated demonstrations with even one or two verified human examples as anchors. This hybrid approach captures the convenience of automation while maintaining a quality floor set by trusted references.</p>
