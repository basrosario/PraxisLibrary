                <p class="page-subtitle fade-in">When a student gets a math problem wrong, a good teacher doesn&rsquo;t just say &ldquo;try again&rdquo; &mdash; they give a hint based on the attempt. Progressive-Hint Prompting applies this teaching strategy: the model&rsquo;s previous answer becomes a hint for its next attempt, progressively guiding it toward the correct solution through iterative refinement.</p>

                        <span class="highlight-box__title">Technique Context: 2023</span>
                        <p><strong>Introduced:</strong> Progressive-Hint Prompting (PHP) was introduced in 2023 by Zheng et al., addressing the observation that models often &ldquo;almost&rdquo; get the right answer on their first attempt. Rather than starting from scratch, PHP feeds the model&rsquo;s previous answer back as a hint: &ldquo;Your previous attempt yielded X. Use this as a hint to try again.&rdquo; This leverages the partial correctness of initial attempts, progressively refining toward the right answer through iterative rounds.</p>
                        <p><strong>Modern LLM Status:</strong> PHP&rsquo;s iterative refinement pattern has become a <strong>staple in production AI systems</strong>. Modern reasoning workflows often use multiple rounds of generation and refinement. PHP&rsquo;s specific contribution &mdash; using the model&rsquo;s own output as a guiding hint &mdash; is particularly effective for mathematical reasoning, where initial attempts often identify the right approach but make calculation errors. The technique complements self-consistency by providing a refinement path rather than just voting among independent attempts.</p>

                        <h2 class="split-section__title">Wrong Answers Contain Useful Information</h2>
                        <p class="split-section__text">Most self-correction techniques ask the model to start fresh or identify errors. PHP takes a different approach: it uses the previous answer as a positive signal &mdash; a hint that contains useful information even when incorrect. The model is told &ldquo;The answer might be X&rdquo; and asked to solve the problem with that hint in mind. If X is correct, the model confirms it. If X is partially wrong, the hint still narrows the search space.</p>
                        <p class="split-section__text"><strong>Through successive rounds, the hints converge toward the correct answer.</strong> Each iteration builds on the previous one rather than discarding it. The model doesn&rsquo;t need to identify what was wrong &mdash; it just needs to solve the problem again with a useful starting point.</p>
                        <p class="split-section__text">Think of it like a game of &ldquo;warmer/colder&rdquo; &mdash; each attempt gets the model closer, and the previous answer serves as an anchor that prevents it from wandering in completely wrong directions.</p>

                                <p>A wrong answer often contains useful information: the right approach with a calculation error, or the right formula with the wrong substitution. By feeding this back as a hint rather than discarding it, PHP preserves the partial progress and gives the model a narrower search space for its next attempt.</p>

Use PHP with a verification step: once the answer converges, check it against constraints or test cases before accepting. Convergence is a strong signal, not a guarantee.</p>
