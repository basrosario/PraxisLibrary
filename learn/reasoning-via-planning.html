                        <p><strong>Introduced:</strong> Reasoning via Planning (RAP) was published in 2023 by Hao et al. The technique repurposes the LLM in a dual role: as a <strong>world model</strong> that predicts the consequences of reasoning steps (states), and as a <strong>reasoning agent</strong> that proposes next actions. Combined with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) &mdash; the same algorithm family behind AlphaGo &mdash; RAP enables strategic exploration of the reasoning space. The model doesn&rsquo;t just follow one chain of thought; it explores multiple paths, backtracks from dead ends, and selects the most promising reasoning trajectory. RAP outperformed standard Chain-of-Thought on math, logic, and commonsense reasoning tasks.</p>
                        <p><strong>Modern LLM Status:</strong> Reasoning via Planning (RAP) was ahead of its time, combining planning algorithms with LLM reasoning. In 2026, the MCTS-based approach has been adopted by agent frameworks like LATS (Language Agent Tree Search). The core insight &mdash; that <strong>reasoning can be treated as a planning problem with search</strong> &mdash; is now foundational to agentic AI systems. While the computational overhead of full MCTS remains significant, the principle of deliberate, search-guided reasoning has influenced how modern models handle complex multi-step problems internally.</p>

                        <h2 class="split-section__title">Reasoning as Strategic Search</h2>
                        <p class="split-section__text">Standard Chain-of-Thought prompting produces a single reasoning path: the model starts at the beginning, thinks step by step, and arrives at an answer. But what if that first path leads to a dead end? What if the model makes an error in step two that corrupts everything downstream? Standard CoT has no mechanism to backtrack, explore alternatives, or compare different reasoning strategies.</p>
                        <p class="split-section__text"><strong>RAP reframes reasoning as a search problem.</strong> Each reasoning step is a &ldquo;move&rdquo; in a game tree. The LLM acts as the world model (predicting what state results from each move) and as the agent (choosing which move to make). MCTS then orchestrates the search: it explores multiple branches, evaluates their promise through simulated rollouts, and concentrates computational effort on the most promising paths.</p>
                        <p class="split-section__text">Think of it like a chess grandmaster who doesn&rsquo;t just play the first good-looking move. They mentally explore several candidate moves, simulate the opponent&rsquo;s responses, evaluate resulting positions, and then choose the move with the best expected outcome &mdash; except here, the &ldquo;opponent&rdquo; is the complexity of the problem itself.</p>

                                <p>RAP&rsquo;s innovation is using the same LLM for two distinct functions simultaneously. As the <strong>world model</strong>, it predicts: &ldquo;If I take this reasoning step, what will the resulting state look like?&rdquo; As the <strong>agent</strong>, it decides: &ldquo;Given the current state, what reasoning step should I try next?&rdquo; This self-play dynamic, guided by MCTS, allows the model to <strong>deliberate</strong> rather than merely generate &mdash; trading speed for substantially better accuracy on hard problems.</p>

                                    Clue 2: Cat owner = blue = Alice. Therefore Alice has the cat.<br>
                                    Clue 3: Bob &ne; fish. Remaining pets: {dog, fish} for {Bob, Carol}. Bob = dog, Carol = fish.<br><br>
                                    <strong>Verification rollout:</strong> Alice (cat, blue), Bob (dog, red), Carol (fish, green). Check all constraints: Alice not red (pass), cat owner is blue/Alice (pass), Bob no fish (pass), Carol green (pass). All constraints satisfied.<br><br>
                                    <strong>RAP result:</strong> The search confirmed a unique solution with no backtracking needed &mdash; constraint propagation from the color assignments resolved everything. In harder puzzles with ambiguous early choices, MCTS would explore multiple assignment branches before finding the valid one. <em>Always verify logical deductions by checking all original constraints against the final answer.</em></p>

                    <div class="callout-title">From Reasoning to Agency</div>
                    <p>RAP demonstrated that the same search algorithms powering game-playing AI (like AlphaGo&rsquo;s MCTS) can be applied to language reasoning. This insight opened the door to a new generation of agentic systems. LATS (Language Agent Tree Search) extends RAP&rsquo;s approach to agents that interact with external tools and environments. Everything of Thoughts (XoT) pushes further by pre-training the search policy. If you&rsquo;re building AI agents that need to plan and reason, RAP&rsquo;s architecture is the conceptual foundation.</p>
