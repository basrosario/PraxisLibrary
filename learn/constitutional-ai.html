                        <p><strong>Introduced:</strong> Constitutional AI was developed in 2022 by Bai et al. at Anthropic. The technique was created to address a critical bottleneck in AI alignment: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) requires enormous amounts of expensive human labeling to teach models what constitutes harmful or unhelpful output. CAI proposed an alternative &mdash; give the model an explicit set of principles (a &ldquo;constitution&rdquo;) and have it critique and revise its own responses. This self-supervised approach, called RLAIF (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback), dramatically reduced the need for human annotators while maintaining or improving alignment quality.</p>
                        <p><strong>Modern LLM Status:</strong> Constitutional AI from Anthropic is one of the most influential alignment techniques in modern AI. In 2026, the principle-based self-critique approach is used by virtually all major AI labs. The concept of defining explicit principles (a &ldquo;constitution&rdquo;) for AI behavior has become a standard practice in responsible AI deployment. Anthropic&rsquo;s Claude models are trained using Constitutional AI principles. Beyond training, the core pattern &mdash; having a model evaluate its own output against stated criteria &mdash; has become a widely adopted prompting technique for improving response quality, safety, and alignment in production systems. CAI&rsquo;s influence extends into policy discussions about AI governance, where the idea of codified behavioral rules resonates with regulatory frameworks.</p>

                <div class="split-section split-section--center fade-in-up">

                        <h2 class="split-section__title">Principles as Guardrails</h2>
                        <p class="split-section__text">Traditional AI alignment depends on humans reviewing model outputs and labeling them as good or bad. This works, but it does not scale: there are far more possible model responses than any team of human reviewers can evaluate. Worse, human reviewers disagree with each other, bring their own biases, and cannot maintain consistency across millions of evaluations.</p>
                        <p class="split-section__text"><strong>Constitutional AI reframes alignment as a rule-following problem.</strong> Instead of asking &ldquo;is this response good?&rdquo; (subjective, expensive, inconsistent), CAI asks &ldquo;does this response violate any of these specific principles?&rdquo; (objective, scalable, consistent). The model reads its own output, evaluates it against each principle in the constitution, identifies violations, and generates a revised response that resolves them. This critique-revise loop can repeat until the output satisfies all principles.</p>
                        <p class="split-section__text">Think of it as the difference between having a teacher grade every essay versus giving students a detailed rubric and asking them to self-edit. The rubric (constitution) makes expectations explicit and enables self-improvement at scale, while the teacher (human reviewer) only needs to spot-check rather than review every submission.</p>

                                <span class="highlight-box__title">Why Self-Critique Scales Better Than Human Review</span>
                                <p>RLHF requires a human to evaluate every response the model might produce. CAI requires humans only to write the principles &mdash; a one-time investment that then applies across all future outputs. When you discover a new category of harmful output, you add a principle to the constitution rather than relabeling thousands of examples. This makes CAI <strong>compositional</strong>: each new principle builds on the existing constitution without invalidating prior work. The system gets better by adding rules, not by retraining from scratch.</p>

                                <p><strong>Critique:</strong> &ldquo;The response suggests using emotional manipulation and logical fallacies to win an argument.

                    <p>You do not need to train a model from scratch to use Constitutional AI principles. The critique-revise pattern works as a <strong>prompting technique</strong> right now: write a set of principles relevant to your use case, include them in your system prompt, and instruct the model to evaluate its own responses against those principles before delivering them. This &ldquo;constitutional prompting&rdquo; approach gives you many of CAI&rsquo;s benefits &mdash; consistent policy enforcement, transparent reasoning about safety decisions, and auditability &mdash; without any model training. Always verify the model&rsquo;s self-critique is actually catching the issues you care about.</p>
                    <p>A practical starting point: write 5&ndash;10 principles specific to your domain, test them against known failure cases, and iterate. Good constitutions are <strong>specific enough to be actionable</strong> (&ldquo;do not recommend medications without advising professional consultation&rdquo;) rather than vague (&ldquo;be helpful&rdquo;). The more concrete your principles, the more reliably the model can evaluate its own compliance.</p>
