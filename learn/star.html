                        <p><strong>Introduced:</strong> STaR was published in 2022 by Zelikman et al. It addresses a fundamental bootstrapping problem: getting high-quality reasoning demonstrations to train models requires either expensive human annotation or a model that can already reason well. STaR breaks this chicken-and-egg problem by having the model generate its own training data. It attempts problems, filters for correct answers, and fine-tunes on those successes. Through iterative rounds, reasoning quality improves exponentially &mdash; each generation of the model produces better training data for the next.</p>
                        <p><strong>Modern LLM Status:</strong> STaR&rsquo;s self-improvement paradigm has become foundational to modern AI training. The concept of using model-generated reasoning chains as training data underlies techniques like RLHF, DPO, and constitutional AI training. While the original paper focused on fine-tuning, the prompt-level insight &mdash; having models evaluate and learn from their own successful reasoning &mdash; applies broadly to any iterative prompting workflow where you want to accumulate and reuse effective reasoning patterns.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <div class="split-section split-section--center fade-in-up">

                        <h2 class="split-section__title">Bootstrap Reasoning from Scratch</h2>
                        <p class="split-section__text">Traditional training requires human-written reasoning examples. STaR eliminates this bottleneck through a clever loop: (1) Attempt many problems with reasoning chains, (2) Keep only the chains that produce correct answers, (3) Fine-tune the model on those successful chains, (4) Repeat. With each iteration, the model generates higher-quality reasoning chains, which provide better training data, which produces an even better model.</p>
                        <p class="split-section__text"><strong>The secret weapon is hindsight rationalization.</strong> For problems the model initially gets wrong, STaR provides the correct answer and asks the model to work backward &mdash; generating a &ldquo;hindsight&rdquo; rationale explaining how to reach that answer. This teaches from mistakes rather than just discarding them, dramatically accelerating improvement.</p>
                        <p class="split-section__text">Think of it like a student who takes a practice test, reviews only the questions they got right to understand their best reasoning patterns, then also studies the answer key for missed questions to learn how those solutions work &mdash; becoming a stronger test-taker with each round.</p>

                                <p>The key insight is selection pressure. By generating many reasoning attempts and keeping only the correct ones, STaR creates a curated dataset of successful reasoning patterns specific to the problem types the model encounters. This is more targeted than generic training data and scales without human annotation cost.</p>
