                <div class="about-content stagger-children">
                    <div class="about-block about-block-featured">
                        <p class="about-intro">A devoted husband and loving father, dedicated to driving meaningful change and innovation that leads to a better world than the one we all inherited.</p>
                        <p>When I think about drive and when I think about purpose, I think about Family. I think about the drive and purpose their love and friendships provide for me. My wife &amp; my daughter are some of the strongest people I have ever met, they have to live with me, barely get to see me, and are forced to hear me &ldquo;babble&rdquo; on every day. So, yes... I would say that they truly must be.</p>
                        <p>My family, like many others, lives with neurodivergence. We all deal with challenges, some visible, and some invisible. Of course, seen or unseen, these challenges are ALL hard to navigate. Still, its together that we face them, and its together that we get through.</p>
                        <p>Being Neurodivergent myself, I understand the moments that shape our daily lives, and the short-term and long-term planning it takes to succeed in navigating systems that were never designed with complexity in mind.</p>
                        <p>I know that for me, it was a struggle to fit into systems that focused on testing a fish on its ability to climb a tree.</p>
                        <p>I built Praxis to help change the way we look at systems, to change the way we work in systems, to change the way we develope systems, and to change the way we innovate, get curious, and levearge AI to breathe life into our ideas everyday.</p>
                        <p>Through "Praxis", I beleive that the Human &amp; AI relationship, when used to enhance humanities already enherint abilities, will be the KEY to unlocking the potential to build the systems that will truly better our world.</p>
                        <p>Walking alongside my family on our journey has brought me the WQ tool of self-reflection. I have to pause to give a Big thank you to Ryan Leak - Author of "How to Work with Complicated People: Strategies for Effective Collaboration with (Nearly) Anyone" for this wisdom, as it has in turn taught me that peace is in patience, love is in self-advocacy, as well as advocating for others, that discipline is the hard work that brings ideas to life &amp; life to ideas, and that most importantly, that it takes Praxis to make things happen. (See what I did there.)</p>
                        <p>My family are among some of the silent sufferers, my mother-in-law, sister-in-law, wife, and daughter all have a connective tissue disorder, called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. At its core, EDS is a connective tissue disorder. Think of connective tissue as the &ldquo;glue&rdquo; or the scaffolding of your body. It&rsquo;s made of proteins like collagen that give structure and strength to your skin, joints, blood vessels, and organs.</p>
                        <p>In someone with EDS, the &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; for that glue is a bit off. Because the glue is weak or too stretchy, the body doesn&rsquo;t hold itself together quite as firmly as it should. Because connective tissue is found everywhere in the body, EDS isn&rsquo;t just about &ldquo;bendy thumbs.&rdquo; It can affect digestion, heart rate, and energy levels. It&rsquo;s often called an &ldquo;invisible illness&rdquo; because someone might look perfectly fine on the outside while their joints are causing significant chronic pain on the inside.</p>
                        <p>When systems work well, lives improve. When they don&rsquo;t, the cost is carried quietly by families who look to persevere anyway.....</p>
                        <p>I carry this truth with me everyday</p>

                    <div class="about-block">
                        <p>Like many, I commute long hours each day. I sacrafice time, energy, and memories to support efforts that I find deep purpose in. My commitment goes beyond dedication and professionalism, it is fueld by unwavering purpose. I am committed to a purpose driven path in life. Because of this path, I concider myself a purpose driven leader, I&rsquo;m committed to the long-term growth nd success of the people I interact with every day. All of them&hellip; (me included!)</p>
                        <p>Professionally, I operate in complex, high-expectation environments where scale, precision, and trust are essential. I bring a disciplined, system-oriented approach to my work, balancing technical depth with empathy and long-term vision execution.</p>

                    <div class="about-block">
                        <h3>Why Praxis?</h3>
                        <p>We believe strongly in Praxis as an idea: ideas matter and are manifested into life when they are carried through with stewardship and purpose. This is a core fundamental of praxis, to breathing thought into existence, we believe this is at the very heart of AI. "AI Stewardship"</p>
                        <p>Intent, planning, purpose, and impact matter. This is the essence of Praxis, of bringing theory to practice and connecting thought to life. Our work aligns deeply with our purpose: The betterment of the communities and the world our families, friends, and our communities live in. By providing accurate, easliy accessible AI educational content to everyone, Praxis is actually putting its own theories to practice.</p>
                        <p>Organizations committed to serving this cause serve a greater purpose. They strengthen and affect actual changes in our world, and by doing so they directly contribute to the betterment of the people, communities, and world they serve and operate in.</p>
                        <p>These organizations need and deserve the focus and dedication of purpose-driven, steadfast, talented individuals to truly make innovative and genuine impacts on the people they serve every day. That is the essence of Praxis</p>
                        <p>Praxis Library represents the authentic and purpose-driven effort that we wholeheartedly put into life every day. We do this to support and serve our families, the people we care for, the communities we serve, and to push forward on the mission of making the world a better place for humanity every day, one person at a time.</p>
                        <p>That belief drives how we plan, how we lead, and how we execute.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title fade-in-up">The Work Behind the Purpose</h2>
                <p class="section-subtitle fade-in-up">I am always building where complexity is unavoidable and clarity must be earned</p>

                <div class="about-content stagger-children">
                    <div class="about-block">
                        <p>I&rsquo;ve spent my career and still contribute to leading initiatives of all sizes, where the margin for error is small and the impact is significant. These efforts often span large populations, distributed teams, and mission-critical systems.</p>
                        <p>I am comfortable operating where complexity is unavoidable and clarity must be built.</p>
                        <p>Praxis Library is the culmination of that approach. What you see here began as an idea: that AI literacy should be accessible to everyone, not gatekept by technical jargon or paywalled resources. From concept to blueprint to launch, we designed the architecture, wrote the curriculum, built the interactive tools, and iterated through countless revisions. Each page, each methodology breakdown, each quiz question was critiqued, balanced, and refined. Working alongside Claude Code as an AI-assisted development partner, we applied the same systems thinking and disciplined execution that define my professional work. The result is a resource built with intention, tested through use, and offered freely to anyone ready to learn.</p>

                    <p>My wife and daughter ground me. They give meaning to long days, hard decisions, and sustained effort. I have been with my wife for 17 years, and she has been a rock in my life. She gave me the most precious gift anyone has ever given me, and I will always be grateful to her for her friendship and her love. I want to build a world that serves them better than the ones we inherited, and contribute to systems that do the same.</p>
                    <p>This poem was written shortly after my daughter was born. It is a promise I carry with me still.</p>
