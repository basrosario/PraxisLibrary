                        <p>Family is not separate from my work or my purpose. It is the source of it. The women in my family live with neurodivergence and connective tissue disorders, including Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. These realities are not abstract to me. They shape daily life, long-term planning, and the way we navigate systems that were never designed with complexity in mind.</p>
                        <p>Walking alongside this journey has taught me patience, advocacy, and discipline. It has also sharpened my sense of responsibility to people, to process, and to outcomes. When systems work well, lives improve. When they don't, the cost is carried quietly by families who persevere anyway.</p>
                        <p>That understanding follows me everywhere.</p>

                    <div class="about-block">
                        <p>Like many, I commute long hours each day. I have learned to roll my sleeves up and show up as close to 100% as I can every day. My drive comes from one purpose and one purpose alone: I'm committed to the long-term success of the people I interact with every day. All of them.</p>
                        <p>Professionally, I operate in complex, high-expectation environments where scale, precision, and trust are essential. I bring a disciplined, systems-oriented approach to my work, balancing technical depth with empathy and long-term vision with execution.</p>

                    <div class="about-block">
                        <h3>Why Praxis?</h3>
                        <p>I believe strongly in <strong>praxis</strong> as an idea: ideas matter and are manifested into life when they are carried through with stewardship, responsibility, and purpose.</p>
                        <p>Intent, planning, and impact matter. This is the essence of Praxis, of bringing theory to practice and connecting thought to life. My work aligns deeply with my purpose: the betterment of the communities and the world my family, friends, other families, countless communities, and I live in.</p>
                        <p>Organizations committed to serving this cause serve a greater purpose. They strengthen and affect actual changes in our world. They directly contribute to the betterment of the communities and world they operate in.</p>
                        <p>These organizations need and deserve the focus and dedication of purpose-driven, steadfast, talented individuals to truly make innovative and genuine impact on the people they serve every day.</p>
                        <p>Praxis Library represents the authentic and purpose-driven effort that I wholeheartedly put into every day, to support and serve the family I cherish, the people I care for, the communities I serve, and to the mission of making the world a better place for humanity every day, one person at a time.</p>
                        <p>That belief drives how I plan, how I lead, and how I execute.</p>

                <p class="section-subtitle fade-in-up">Building where complexity is unavoidable and clarity must be earned</p>

                <div class="about-content stagger-children">
                    <div class="about-block">
                        <p>I've spent my career contributing to and leading initiatives where the margin for error is small and the impact is significant. These efforts often span large populations, distributed teams, and mission-critical systems.</p>
                        <p>I am comfortable operating where complexity is unavoidable and clarity must be built.</p>
                        <p>Praxis Library is the culmination of that approach. What you see here began as an idea: that AI literacy should be accessible to everyone, not gatekept by technical jargon or paywalled resources. From concept to blueprint to launch, I designed the architecture, wrote the curriculum, built the interactive tools, and iterated through countless revisions. Each page, each methodology breakdown, each quiz question was critiqued, balanced, and refined. Working alongside Claude Code as an AI-assisted development partner, I applied the same systems thinking and disciplined execution that define my professional work. The result is a resource built with intention, tested through use, and offered freely to anyone ready to learn.</p>

                    <p>My wife and daughter ground me. They give meaning to long days, hard decisions, and sustained effort. I have been with my wife for 17 years, and she has been a rock in my life. She gave me the most precious gift anyone has ever given me, and I will always be grateful to her for her friendship and her love. I want to build a world that serves them better than the ones we inherited, and contribute to systems that do the same.</p>
                    <p>This poem was written shortly after my daughter was born. It is a promise I carry with me still.</p>
