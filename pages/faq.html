Training usage: Can your code be used to train future models? Third-party sharing: Is your data shared with other companies? Compliance: Does the service meet your regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2)?

                            <p>A hallucination is when AI generates information that sounds plausible but is actually incorrect or made up. This includes fake citations, invented statistics, fictional events, or confident statements about things the AI doesn't actually know.</p>

                            <p>AI models are trained on vast amounts of code—including code with security flaws.

                            <p><strong>The risk is real:</strong> A single vulnerability in production code can lead to data breaches, financial loss, legal liability, and damaged reputation.</p>
